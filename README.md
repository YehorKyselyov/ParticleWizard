## Overview
This repository hosts a dual-purpose library designed for high-energy particle physics computations, focusing on meson and quark data management and branching ratio calculations for hypothetical particle physics reactions.

## Features

### Meson and Quark Database
The library includes a detailed database of mesons and quarks, allowing quick and easy access to essential data about these particles. This feature aims to streamline particle physics calculations by providing a centralized repository of particle properties, readily used in various computations.

### Branching Ratio Calculator
The library features a branching ratio calculator tailored for evaluating the branching ratios of abstract reactions of the form:
- Meson â†’ New Physics Particle + Meson
Currently, it supports scenarios where the initial meson is a pseudoscalar, the new physics particle is a scalar, and the resulting meson is either a pseudoscalar or a scalar. This tool assists researchers in exploring potential new physics scenarios by providing a means to compute the branching ratios of hypothetical reactions involving mesons.

## Future Plans
The library is under active development, with plans for expansion to cover a broader range of particles and reactions. The goal is to extend the functionality to encompass all necessary calculations for an upcoming research article in particle physics, including support for additional particle types and reaction scenarios.
