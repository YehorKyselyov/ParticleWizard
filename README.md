This repository hosts a dual-purpose library designed for high-energy particle physics computations, particularly in the context of meson and quark data management and branching ratio calculations for hypothetical particle physics reactions.
Meson and Quark Database
The library includes a detailed database of mesons and quarks, allowing for quick and easy access to essential data about these particles. This feature is intended to streamline the process of particle physics calculations by providing a centralized repository of particle properties, which can be readily used in various computations without the need for repetitive data entry.
Branching Ratio Calculator
A significant component of this library is the branching ratio calculator, which is tailored for evaluating the branching ratios of abstract reactions of the form:
Meson â†’ New Physics Particle + Meson
Currently, the calculator supports scenarios where the initial meson is a pseudoscalar, the new physics particle is a scalar, and the resulting meson is either a pseudoscalar or a scalar. This tool is designed to assist researchers in exploring potential new physics scenarios by providing a means to compute the branching ratios of hypothetical reactions involving mesons.
